## What's LLM good at (source: https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/3/weird-world-of-llms/ )

About 60% of my usage is for writing code. 30% is helping me understand things about the world, and 10% is brainstorming and helping with idea generation and thought processes.

- They’re surprisingly good at code. Why is that? Think about how complex the grammar of the English language is compared to the grammar used by Python or JavaScript. Code is much, much easier.

- I’m no longer intimidated by jargon. I read academic papers by pasting pieces of them into GPT-4 and asking it to explain every jargon term in the extract. Then I ask it a second time to explain the jargon it just used for those explanations. I find after those two rounds it’s broken things down to the point where I can understand what the paper is talking about.

- I no longer dread naming things. I can ask it for 20 ideas for names, and maybe option number 15 is the one I go with.
Always ask for “twenty ideas for”—you’ll find that the first ten are super-obvious, but once you get past those things start getting interesting. Often it won’t give you the idea that you’ll use, but one of those ideas well be the spark that will set you in the right direction.
It’s the best thesaurus ever. You can say “a word that kind of means...” and it will get it for you every time.

- A really surprising one: it’s amazing at API design. A common criticism of these things is that they always come up with the most obvious answer... but when you’re designing an API that’s exactly what you want.
